# Tic-Tac-Toe


Tic Tac Toe 


The Tic Tac Toe game is developed in Python. The game rule is the same as the tic tac toe game that most of us played during our childhood.
The flow of the Tic Tac Toe game is quite simple. When the program starts, players will see a 3 by 3 grid. The first player will be assigned an “X”, and the second player will be assigned an “O”. Player one and Player two take turns, and they need to pick the best spots that reach the winning condition. The winning condition is very straightforward: if there are three Xs or three Os that are connected horizontally, vertically or diagonally, the game will have a winner immediately, and the program will end. When the game outcome is finalized,  the program will display a popup window, which shows the winner of the game or that is a tie game.
