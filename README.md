Tic Tac Toe 


The Tic Tac Toe game is developed in Python. The game rule is the same as the tic tac toe game that most of us played during our childhood.
The flow of the Tic Tac Toe game is quite simple. When the program starts, players will see a 3 by 3 grid. The first player will be assigned an “X”, and the second player will be assigned an “O”. Player one and Player two take turns, and they need to pick the best spots that reach the winning condition. The winning condition is very straightforward: if there are three Xs or three Os that are connected horizontally, vertically or diagonally, the game will have a winner immediately, and the program will end. When the game outcome is finalized,  the program will display a popup window, which shows the winner of the game or that is a tie game.

In the image above, it shows player one and player two are playing the Tic Tac Toe game. This image shows player one is one step away from winning the game. Once player one selected the last box in the third row, there will be three "X"s connecting diagonally, which means player one wins the game.

When player one selected the last box in the third row, a winning condition is met, and player one win the Tic Tac Toe game. A message window will pop up and letting players know who win the game. At the same time, the "X"s and the "O"s on the game board will be cleared. In the image above, it shows how it looks after player one win the game.

In the image above, it shows how a tie game looks like. Tie game means no winner in the game. In the image above, the last player will place a "X" in the last box. If you observe the game board carefully, neither player 1 nor player 2 can form the winning pattern, so this is a tie game.
